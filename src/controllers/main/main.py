"""
When copying for second robot, things that need to be changed are:
Behaviour: 
    - block colour red/blue, spin direction x2
    - update setting red found blocks to 1, and can only go for 0 and 2
    - update [1.06, 1.06]
Detection: origin position, friend corner wall definitions, spin direction correct coordinate
Gps: my box coordinate definitions
